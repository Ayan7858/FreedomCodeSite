1. Fork the "FreedomCodeSite" repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of the GitHub page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheFreedomCodes/FreedomCodeSite
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

3. Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine and find the `README.md` file.

4. Open the `README.md` file in a text editor, and replace all occurrences of the original website name with "FreedomCode."

5. Save the changes to the `README.md` file.

6. Commit the changes to your local repository:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update website name to FreedomCode"
```

7. Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

8. Finally, go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request to merge your changes into the original repository.

The maintainers of the "FreedomCode" repository will review your changes and decide whether to merge them into the main repository.

Remember that updating someone else's repository requires following the project's contributing guidelines and respecting the maintainers' decisions. If you don't have the necessary permissions or rights to make these changes, you can only suggest the modifications to the repository's maintainers through a pull request.
